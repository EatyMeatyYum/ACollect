ACollect is a comprehensive harvesting, extracting, and gathering package for the online game Achaea. Due to the flexible nature of the package you do not need to have all three tradeskills, but you will need at least one for this package to have any actual value.

PRE-REQUISITES: In order for ACollect to work you will need the following:

Keneanung's eventBus package: https://keneanung.github.io/nexus-event-bus/EventBus.nxs
Argwin's eventBus events package
And the ACollect package
They MUST be in that order in your Reflex Packages screen in Achaea.

NOTE: After installing all three packages, in the right order, you will need to either log off and then back on, or reset the package in the Reflex Packages settings screen.

HOW'S IT WORK?
 - Use ACOLLECT SELECT HERBS to choose what herbs you want to harvest
 - Use ACOLLECT SELECT MINERALS to choose what minerals you want to extract
 - Use ACOLLECT SELECT GATHERABLES to choose what items you want to gather (NOTE: not all gatherables work just yet)
NOTE: When you use each 'select' command your rift caps will be shown. If they are not correct (and they likely aren't) use the commands shown in the menu to change them.
NOTE2: If you want to harvest, extract, or gather more than your rift can hold, select the 'overharvest' option at the top of the menus.

To start collecting the things you've chosen, use ACOLLECT ON, and then use ACOLLECT OFF to turn it off.

As you walk around, you will automatically harvest, extract, or gather the things you've chosen and put them in your rift.

For minerals, if you're not sure where to find them, use ACOLLECT MINERAL LOCATE <mineral> for a list of known places where that mineral can be extracted.
For herbs, if you're not sure where to find them, use ACOLLECT LIST for a list of all herbs and where to find them. It's incomplete. Because I got tired of typing.
